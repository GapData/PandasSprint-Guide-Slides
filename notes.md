When reviewing a Pull Request, you can use those questions:

- Is the **language** correct? Not everybody is a native english speaker or as fluent in it as others: giving feedback on language can therefore be very helpful.

- Do you **understand everything** that is explained? Is all terminology clear? If a certain explanation is **not clear for you**, we **need to improve** this! You can add a **comment** indicating what is not clear, and if possible why. Especially if you are not the crazy pandas expert, your feedback on this is essential.

- Does the PR looks good from a technical perspective (does it **follow the guidelines**)? Extra pairs of eyes are always useful!

- Do you **miss something** in the PR? A **typical use case** missing in the examples? A **related method** that would be good to link to?

- And also if it looks good, that is useful to know, and **don't hesitate to approve** a PR.
